# Detailed analysis report 

To view the html analysis report you need to open this link and modify it by adding a specific token at the end.

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ni-Ar/TAF2_OE_AS/main/TAF2OE_AS_analysis.html?token=<INSEERT TOKEN HERE>

The document token is a secuirty feature to keep the file private on GitHub. It changes often and at every new modification, so there's no efficient way to generate a permanent link while this repository is private. To find the token go to [the html file page in this repo](https://github.com/Ni-Ar/TAF2_OE_AS/blob/main/TAF2OE_AS_analysis.html) and click on the "Raw" button on the right. This opens a new web page where the link ends with `token=<TOKEN>`. Copy the token and paste it to the link above.
